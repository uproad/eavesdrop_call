# EveDropCall

# WIP
You can't install this Gem by gem command. Sorry. :-)



Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/eve_drop_call`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'eve_drop_call', git: 'git@github.com:uproad/eve_drop_call.git'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

   $ gem install specific_install
   $ gem specific_install git@github.com:uproad/eve_drop_call.git master

## Usage

### If you want to use in rspec.

Write this...

```ruby:spec_helper.rb
RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.before :suite do
    EveDropCall.eavesdrop(TargetKlass)
  end
  config.after :suite do
    Callstack.dump
  end
end
```

$ rspec spec
$ less tmp/evedropcall_stack.log

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
